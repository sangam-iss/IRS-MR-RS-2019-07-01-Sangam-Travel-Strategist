# **Executive Summary:**

Expert Systems are a combination of computer programming and data to imitate human expertise in narrow business domains. According to Wikipedia, _in artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert_. Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The error rate of a successful expert system is low, sometimes much lower than the human error rate for the same task. They are very good in capturing very complex patterns which cannot be captured by data mining. We have identified the necessity of building an expert system to recommend places and attractions to Singapore Tourists.

Tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors in Singapore. According to 2018 Q4 report of Singapore Tourism Board, tourism sector achieved record highs in International Visitor Arrivals and Tourism receipts for the third year consecutively. Around 18.5 million visitors visited Singapore in 2018 and it accounted for Tourism Receipts of S$26.9 billion.m

Due to the rapid growth of this sector, tourists can easily be overwhelmed with the options they have. In order to facilitate further growth in this sector and help the tourists, we have developed an expert system application which can recommend attractions to tourists based on their interests. In addition to that it also provides an optimized tour itinerary based on user interests.
